# 📚 Book Recommender System

Welcome to the **Book Recommender System** – an AI-powered recommendation engine built using **Machine Learning (Decision Tree Classifier)** and **Streamlit**. This project was created as a beginner-friendly AI/ML app to suggest books based on user preferences like genre, author, and reading history.

Whether you're a bookworm or a curious beginner exploring machine learning, this project gives a practical peek into how recommendation engines work in the real world.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Recommend books based on user preferences.
- Demonstrate how ML algorithms like Decision Trees can be applied in recommendation systems.
- Build a minimal yet interactive UI using Streamlit.
- Provide a simple, easy-to-understand codebase for AI beginners.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Python** | Programming language |
| **Pandas** | Data handling and preprocessing |
| **Scikit-learn** | Machine learning (Decision Tree Classifier) |
| **Streamlit** | Web application framework |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User inputs** basic preferences (e.g., favorite genre or author).
2. The **trained ML model** analyzes the input.
3. It recommends a list of books based on learned patterns from the dataset.
4. All results are displayed instantly in a clean **Streamlit web interface**.
